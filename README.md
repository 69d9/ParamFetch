# ParamFetch
ParamFetch is a tool for extracting links from web pages, allowing you to filter them based on specific URL parameters and check their validity. It saves valid links in a text file (parameter.txt) for easy access later. A must-have for any penetration tester or security researcher looking to analyze and capture parameters on target websites.
